===== CLEANING =====
- Implement ResourceManager
	=> Make AudioPlayer static class
	=> No more MapManager, etc...
- A unique view for maps (Map::view)
	=> Model matrix
	=> Class "Drawable"? Ok, but it's drawn by what?
- Tileset should be a class
- Remove TilesData, etc...
	=> Loaded in xml file by Tileset
- Use smart pointers instead of raw ones
- Use spaces for alignment instead of tabs
- Add Movable class and Movement system
- Add collision handlers
- Add MapObject class (pure virtual class), then InteractiveMapObject (current Object class, handle Events), MapEntity (current Entity class, handles collisions)
	=> Write a better event system (between MapEntity and InteractiveMapObject)
	=> Update Character, Player, Sword, Collectable (inherits of MapEntity class)
- Add a better state management for Characters
- Edit TODO part and check ISSUES part

===== TODO =====
- Finish 'Octorok'
	=> Player can go through enemies sometimes (Enemies don't test collisions with Player)
	=> Add 'Projectile' class (inherits from 'Image'/'Sprite' and 'Entity')
	=> Implement projectiles for octorok
	=> Clean
		-> Maybe create 'OctorokMovement' (or 'RandomMovement')
			~> An improvement of 'Movement' may be required here
			~> CharacterState => PlayerState
			~> CharacterStateManager => PlayerStateManager
			~> In each CharacterState child, replace 'm_character' by 'm_player'
- Implement EnemyManager with 'data/config/enemies.xml'
- Remove sword loading animation, and replace it by palette switch
- Implement 'LanguageManager'
	=> Like Asylia one
- Implement 'NPC' class
	=> Add movement
		-> Add map collisions
		-> Use 'Movement' class
	=> When player press 'A' in front of a NPC, push a 'DialogState' with the NPC's text (maybe turn the NPC too?)
- Rewrite managers to read xml config files
	=> Rewrite 'MapManager' and 'Player'
		-> Add 'tilesets.xml', 'maps.xml' and 'player.xml' config files in 'data/config/' directory
- Write 'ChestManager' and add a way to configure it
- Add 'MovableObject', then 'PotObject' and 'BlockObject'
	=> Movable contains the object movement thing
	=> Pot is a Movable in all ways
	=> Block can be moved once only, and requires the way it can be move
- Add 'PowerBracelet', child of 'Weapon'
	=> Add 'LiftableObject'
		-> 'PotObject' and 'GrassObject' inherits from it
	=> Add 'LiftingState' for Player
- Improve OpenGL code, wrapping it in classes
	=> Write a class VertexBufferObject, and use it in 'TileMap'
	=> Write a class VertexArray, and use it in 'Image' and 'Rectangle'
- Write an 'IOManager' (+ 'File' class?) namespace
	=> Read from a given path (to launch the game outside of its folder)
- Implement a game pad, movable and resizable via config files
- Improve game for OpenGL ES and try on Android
- Write a little game editor with Qt
	=> Add maps
		~> Add objects
		~> Add collectables
		~> Add enemies
		~> Add NPCs

===== ISSUES =====
- Improve collectable objets drop movement
- Rupees are added one by one to the counter in the original game
	=> There's also a sound effect
- Lines have not the correct length in 'Dialog'
	=> Maybe related to the 'Ã '?
- When a color tag starts on one line and finishes on another one, the other line doesn't have color
- In the original game, it's possible to attack during 'PushingState'
- Check sound effect channels in real game
	=> For example, is it possible to hear sword loading sound anymore when link releases spin attack?
	=> It's not possible to hear text 'clicks' during 'tadaaaaaaa' (new item)
	=> Define channel in constructor (and 'load'), so from Sound.cpp
- Sometimes link looks strange
- Use exceptions to prevents memory leaks
- Fix grassDestroy animation
	=> Find a way to rip it
- Fix 'moonwalk' bug
