===== TODO =====
- Weapon system
	-> Working on Sword
		o SpriteAnimation upgraded, can now use (x;y) for each frame
		o SwordFactory creaaated
		- Where to write the animation code?
			-> SwordComponent...
- Inventory system
- Menu
- Grass objects
- Sign object
	-> Same thing as chest, maybe write generic detectors?
- Missing teleporters and rooms
- Battle system
	-> Life management, strengh, etc: BattlerComponent
	-> HurtMovement
	-> BattleSystem

===== CLEAN =====
- There's a lot of specific components, like:
	* ButtonComponent
	* SwordComponent
	* TeleporterComponent
	* etc...
	=> Find a way to merge some of them

===== ISSUES =====
- The dialog arrow in MessageBox disappears too fastly the first time
- Play Scene test, go into the cave, press backspace, play Map test: Segfault
	=> Scene::player should be resetted to avoid this problem
