===== TODO =====
- Finish 'Octorok'
	=> Fix map collisions
		-> Implement a generic function 'Character::mapCollisions()' that works with hitbox and movement vectors
		-> Try to understand better 'Player::mapCollisions()' and rewrite it
	=> Add collisions with 'Player' and 'HurtState' for player
	=> Add collisions with 'Sword' and 'State::Hurt' for octorok
	=> Improve IA to be closer to the original one
		-> Random values are recomputed each frame
	=> Add 'Projectile' class (inherits from 'Image'/'Sprite' and 'Entity')
	=> Implement projectiles for octorok
- Implement 'LanguageManager'
	=> Like Asylia one
- Implement 'NPC' class
	=> Add movement
		-> Add map collisions
		-> Find a way to predefine movement
		-> Implement the realisation of the predefined movemement
	=> When player press 'A' in front of a NPC, push a 'DialogState' with the NPC's text
- Rewrite managers to read xml config files
	=> Rewrite 'MapManager' and 'Player'
		-> Add 'tilesets.xml', 'maps.xml' and 'player.xml' config files in 'data/config/' directory
- Write 'ChestManager'
- Improve OpenGL code, wrapping it in classes
	=> Write a class VertexBufferObject, and use it in 'TileMap'
	=> Write a class VertexArray, and use it in 'Image' and 'Rectangle'
- Write an 'IOManager' (+ 'File' class?) namespace
	=> Read from a given path (to launch the game outside of its folder)
- Implement a game pad, movable and resizable via config files
- Improve game for OpenGL ES and try on Android
- Write a little game editor with Qt
	=> Add maps
		~> Add objects
		~> Add collectables
		~> Add enemies
		~> Add NPCs

===== ISSUES =====
- Improve collectable objets drop movement
- Rupees are added one by one to the counter in the original game
	=> There's also a sound effect
- Lines have not the correct length in 'Dialog'
	=> Maybe related to the 'Ã '?
- When a color tag starts on one line and finishes on another one, the other line doesn't have color
- In the original game, it's possible to attack during 'PushingState'
- Check sound effect channels in real game
	=> For example, is it possible to hear sword loading sound anymore when link releases spin attack?
	=> It's not possible to hear text 'clicks' during 'tadaaaaaaa' (new item)
	=> Define channel in constructor (and 'load'), so from Sound.cpp
- Sometimes link looks strange
- Use exceptions to prevents memory leaks
- Fix grassDestroy animation
	=> Find a way to rip it
- Fix 'moonwalk' bug
