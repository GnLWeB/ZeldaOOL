===== REFACTORING =====
- Implement Battler + HurtState equivalent for Scene::player and octoroks (HealthComponent)
- Improve OpenGL code
	=> Use model matrix instead of raw positions
		-> Base class Transformable?
	=> Write a class VertexArray, and use it in 'Image' and 'Rectangle'
- Add more debug tools, like a Logger class
- Add more unit tests

===== TODO =====
- Finish 'Octorok'
	=> Player can go through enemies sometimes
	=> Implement projectiles for octorok
- Remove sword loading animation, and replace it by palette switch
	=> Improve palette system
- Implement 'Translator'
	=> Like Asylia LanguageManager
- Add 'MovableObject', then 'PotObject' and 'BlockObject'
	=> Movable contains the object movement thing
	=> Pot is a Movable in all ways
	=> Block can be moved once only, or not at all, and requires the way it can be move
- Add 'PowerBracelet'
	=> Pots and grass are liftable
	=> Add State::Lifting for player
- Add NPCs
- Improve sword positions
- Improve game for OpenGL ES and try on Android
- Write a little game editor with Qt
	=> Add maps
		~> Add objects
		~> Add collectables
		~> Add enemies
		~> Add NPCs

===== ISSUES =====
- Player can go through enemies sometimes
- Player can be pushed out of the map during HurtMovement
- Octorok's HurtMovement speed too slow?
- Improve palette system
- Rupees are added one by one to the counter in the original game
	=> There's also a sound effect
- Check sound effect channels in real game
	=> For example, is it possible to hear sword loading sound anymore when link releases spin attack?
	=> It's not possible to hear text 'clicks' during 'tadaaaaaaa' (new item)
	=> Define channel in constructor (and 'load'), so from Sound.cpp
- Fix grassDestroy animation
	=> Find a way to rip it
- Fix 'moonwalk' bug

===== NEW ISSUES =====
- Player is not hurt when using sword?
- It's possible to see an extra frame when using spin attack
