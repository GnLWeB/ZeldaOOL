- Check sound effect channels in real game
	=> For example, is it possible to hear sword loading sound when player release spin attack?

- Add 'Transition' pure virtual class, and its children 'TransitionScrolling', 'TransitionFade', etc...
	=> Improve 'TransitionScrolling' to be closer to the original game
- Implement 'Door' and teleportation ( maybe via MapEvents ? )
- Reimplement 'View' concept?
- Sometimes link looks strange
- Use exceptions to prevents memory leaks
- Improve OpenGL code, wrapping it in classes
- Player can move out of the maps when sword is loading
	=> virtual bool PlayerState::canStartMapTransition();
- Fix grassDestroy animation
	=> Find a way to rip it
- Add 'Enemy' pure virtual class, child of 'Character'
	=> With at least a monster child class, to test battles
- Fix 'moonwalk' bug
