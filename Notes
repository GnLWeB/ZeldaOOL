===== TODO =====
- Find a way for some 'Object' to have an 'update' function	
	=> Helpful for item drawing in 'Chest'
- Implement 'LanguageManager'
	=> Like Asylia one
- Add collectable items
- Add 'Enemy' pure virtual class, child of 'Character'
	=> With at least a monster child class, to test battles
- Implement 'NPC' class
- Rewrite managers to read xml config files
	=> Rewrite 'MapManager' and add 'tilesets.xml' and 'maps.xml' config files in 'data/config/' directory
	=> Rewrite 'Player' and add 'player.xml' config file
- Reimplement 'View' concept
	=> Each View have shaders
		-> Vertex shader: Move the view, rotate (if needed), etc...
		-> Fragment shader: Cut things out of the view (cut textures)
	=> Reimplement it in 'Window'
- Improve OpenGL code, wrapping it in classes
	=> Write a class VertexBufferObject, and use it in 'TileMap'
	=> Write a class VertexArray, and use it in 'Image' and 'Rectangle'
- Write an 'IOManager' (+ 'File' class?) namespace
	=> Read from a given path (to launch the game outside of its folder)
- Implement a game pad, movable and resizable via config files
- Improve game for OpenGL ES and try on Android

===== ISSUES =====
- Lines have not the correct length in 'Dialog'
	=> Maybe related to the 'Ã '?
- When a color tag starts on one line and finishes on another one, the other line doesn't have color
- In the original game, it's possible to attack during 'PushingState'
- Check sound effect channels in real game
	=> For example, is it possible to hear sword loading sound anymore when link releases spin attack?
	=> It's not possible to hear text 'clicks' during 'tadaaaaaaa' (new item)
	=> Define channel in constructor (and 'load'), so from Sound.cpp
- Sometimes link looks strange
- Use exceptions to prevents memory leaks
- Fix grassDestroy animation
	=> Find a way to rip it
- Fix 'moonwalk' bug
