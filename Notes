===== REFACTORING =====
- Improve 'Dialog' and 'DialogState'
	=> See ZeldaOOL
- Improve OpenGL code
	=> Use model matrix instead of raw positions
		-> Base class Transformable?
	=> Write a class VertexArray, and use it in 'Image' and 'Rectangle'
- Improve Sprite and SpriteAnimation
	=> See ZeldaOOL
	=> Add position for frames
- Improve Sword
	=> See the array in SwordFactory of ZeldaOOL
- Improve game object system

===== TODO =====
- Finish 'Octorok'
	=> Player can go through enemies sometimes
	=> Add 'Projectile' class
	=> Implement projectiles for octorok
	=> Clean
- Finish 'NPC'
	=> Player can't move on the side when it collides an NPC
- Remove sword loading animation, and replace it by palette switch
- Implement EnemyLoader with 'data/config/enemies.xml'
- Implement 'Translator'
	=> Like Asylia LanguageManager
- Add 'player.xml' config file in 'data/config/' directory
	=> Add PlayerLoader
- Add 'MovableObject', then 'PotObject' and 'BlockObject'
	=> Movable contains the object movement thing
	=> Pot is a Movable in all ways
	=> Block can be moved once only, or not at all, and requires the way it can be move
- Add 'PowerBracelet', child of 'Weapon'
	=> Add 'LiftableObject'
		-> 'PotObject' and 'GrassObject' inherits from it
	=> Add 'LiftingState' for Player
- Improve game for OpenGL ES and try on Android
- Write a little game editor with Qt
	=> Add maps
		~> Add objects
		~> Add collectables
		~> Add enemies
		~> Add NPCs

===== ISSUES =====
- Player can go through enemies sometimes
- Player can be pushed out of the map during HurtMovement
- Octorok's HurtMovement speed too slow?
- Improve palette system
- Improve collectable objets drop movement
- Rupees are added one by one to the counter in the original game
	=> There's also a sound effect
- Lines have not the correct length in 'Dialog'
	=> Maybe related to the 'Ã '?
- When a color tag starts on one line and finishes on another one, the other line doesn't have color
- Check sound effect channels in real game
	=> For example, is it possible to hear sword loading sound anymore when link releases spin attack?
	=> It's not possible to hear text 'clicks' during 'tadaaaaaaa' (new item)
	=> Define channel in constructor (and 'load'), so from Sound.cpp
- Fix grassDestroy animation
	=> Find a way to rip it
- Fix 'moonwalk' bug
- When link is trying to cut a grass tile being too close nothing happens
- Sometimes the Dialog box is displayed too far in the right
