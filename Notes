- Link continues animation during DialogActivity
- Lines have not the correct length in 'Dialog'
	=> Maybe related to the 'Ã '?
- Implement 'LanguageManager'
	=> Like Asylia one
- Improve OpenGL code, wrapping it in classes
	=> Write a class VertexBufferObject, and use it in 'TileMap'
	=> Write a class VertexArray, and use it in 'Image' and 'Rectangle'
- Check sound effect channels in real game
	=> For example, is it possible to hear sword loading sound anymore when player release spin attack?
- Rewrite managers to read xml config files
	=> Rewrite 'MapManager' and add 'tilesets.xml' and 'maps.xml' config files in 'data/config/' directory
	=> Rewrite 'Player' and add 'player.xml' config file
- Write an 'IOManager' (+ 'File' class?) namespace
	=> Read from a given path (to launch the game outside of its folder)
- Add 'Transition' pure virtual class, and its children 'TransitionScrolling', 'TransitionFade', etc...
	=> Add a little delay before 'TransitionScrolling' to be closer to the original game
- Implement 'Door' and teleportation ( maybe via MapEvents ? )
- Reimplement 'View' concept
	=> Each View have shaders
		-> Vertex shader: Move the view, rotate (if needed), etc...
		-> Fragment shader: Cut things out of the view (cut textures)
	=> Reimplement it in 'Window'
- Sometimes link looks strange
- Use exceptions to prevents memory leaks
- Fix grassDestroy animation
	=> Find a way to rip it
- Add 'Enemy' pure virtual class, child of 'Character'
	=> With at least a monster child class, to test battles
- Fix 'moonwalk' bug
- Implement a game pad, movable and resizable via config files
- Improve game for OpenGL ES and try on Android
