- Manage shaders in Application
	=> pushShader
		=> Add shader to a stack
		=> Use shader
	=> popShader
		=> Pop shader from stack
		=> Use shader
	=> currentShader
		=> Returns the top of the stack
- Improve OpenGL code, wrapping it in classes
	=> Write a class VertexBufferObject, and use it in 'TileMap'
	=> Write a class VertexArray, and use it in 'Image'
- Implement 'Dialog', 'DialogState' and 'DialogManager'
	=> Find the two positions, and the dimension of the box
		=> (x: 8) | (y: 24)
		=> (x: 8) | (y: 96)
		=> (w: 144) | (h: 40)
	=> Find the coordinates for the first character, relatives to the top-left corner of the box
		=> (x: 8) | (y: 6)
	=> Find the padding between each character
		=> 0 (each character is a tile)
	=> Create a class 'Color'
	=> Create a class 'Rectangle' which displays with color like 'Sprites' displays with texture (with new 'VertexArray', so)
	=> Create a class 'Font' using the white font, child of 'Sprite'
		=> Function 'void load(std::string filename)'
		=> Function 'void drawChar(s16 x, s16 y, char c, Color color)'
	=> Create a 'Dialog' class
		=> Enum 'enum Position { Top, Bottom };'
		=> Member 'Position m_position'
		=> Member 'std::string m_text'
- Implement 'LanguageManager'
	=> Like Asylia one
- Check sound effect channels in real game
	=> For example, is it possible to hear sword loading sound when player release spin attack?
- Rewrite managers to read xml config files
	=> Rewrite 'MapManager' and add 'tilesets.xml' and 'maps.xml' config files in 'data/config/' directory
	=> Rewrite 'Player' and add 'player.xml' config file
- Write an 'IOManager' namespace
	=> Read from a given path
- Add 'Transition' pure virtual class, and its children 'TransitionScrolling', 'TransitionFade', etc...
	=> Add a little delay before 'TransitionScrolling' to be closer to the original game
- Implement 'Door' and teleportation ( maybe via MapEvents ? )
- Reimplement 'View' concept
	=> Each View have shaders
		-> Vertex shader: Move the view, rotate (if needed), etc...
		-> Fragment shader: Cut things out of the view (cut texture)
	=> Reimplement it in 'Window'
- Sometimes link looks strange
- Use exceptions to prevents memory leaks
- Player can move out of the maps when sword is loading
	=> virtual bool PlayerState::canStartMapTransition();
- Fix grassDestroy animation
	=> Find a way to rip it
- Add 'Enemy' pure virtual class, child of 'Character'
	=> With at least a monster child class, to test battles
- Fix 'moonwalk' bug
- Improve game for OpenGL ES and try on Android
- Implement a game pad, movable and resizable via config files
