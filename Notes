- Need to fix:
	-> Sword/Map collisions
	-> Pressing 'x' at the beginning of the game makes the animation strange
- Move 'BackgroundMusic', 'SoundEffect' from 'Sound', and move them three to a new folder 'audio'
- Add 'Enemy' pure virtual class, child of 'Character'
- Fix transitions
	-> Smoother transitions (speed >>>> and <<<<<)
- Fix 'moonwalk' bug
- Should write a class "Scene":
	=> Represents the current map
	-> Contains a Map
	-> Contains a std::vector of Entity
	-> Contains infos for Entity
	-> Sets the way each Entity interacts with another
	-> Draws on-map animations
- Add 'SceneManager'
	-> It associates each map and its entities into a 'Scene'
- Add 'Transition' pure virtual class, and its children 'TransitionScrolling', 'TransitionFade', etc...
