===== REFACTORING =====
- Add more debug tools, like a Logger class
- Fix Sword bugs
	=> Sometimes the tile under the player get cutted too, even in spin attack, why?
	=> Sometimes an exception is thrown, catch it
	=> When changing map in loading state the sword stays in its scene
- Improve game object system
	=> Implement Battler + HurtState equivalent for Scene::player and octoroks
- Implement a new Inventory system
	=> Remove Inventory + mapObjects folders + OldGamePadMovement
- Use m_parent in TransitionState
- Improve OpenGL code
	=> Use model matrix instead of raw positions
		-> Base class Transformable?
	=> Write a class VertexArray, and use it in 'Image' and 'Rectangle'
- Improve Filesystem: use stat

===== TODO =====
- Finish 'Octorok'
	=> Player can go through enemies sometimes
	=> Add 'Projectile' class
	=> Implement projectiles for octorok
	=> Clean
- Remove sword loading animation, and replace it by palette switch
- Implement 'Translator'
	=> Like Asylia LanguageManager
- Add 'player.xml' config file in 'data/config/' directory
	=> Add PlayerLoader
- Add 'MovableObject', then 'PotObject' and 'BlockObject'
	=> Movable contains the object movement thing
	=> Pot is a Movable in all ways
	=> Block can be moved once only, or not at all, and requires the way it can be move
- Add 'PowerBracelet'
	=> Pots and grass are liftable
	=> Add State::Lifting for player
- Add NPCs
- Improve sword positions
- Improve game for OpenGL ES and try on Android
- Write a little game editor with Qt
	=> Add maps
		~> Add objects
		~> Add collectables
		~> Add enemies
		~> Add NPCs

===== ISSUES =====
- Player can go through enemies sometimes
- Player can be pushed out of the map during HurtMovement
- Octorok's HurtMovement speed too slow?
- Improve palette system
- Improve collectable objets drop movement
- Rupees are added one by one to the counter in the original game
	=> There's also a sound effect
- Lines have not the correct length in 'Dialog'
	=> Maybe related to the 'Ã '?
- When a color tag starts on one line and finishes on another one, the other line doesn't have color
- Check sound effect channels in real game
	=> For example, is it possible to hear sword loading sound anymore when link releases spin attack?
	=> It's not possible to hear text 'clicks' during 'tadaaaaaaa' (new item)
	=> Define channel in constructor (and 'load'), so from Sound.cpp
- Fix grassDestroy animation
	=> Find a way to rip it
- Fix 'moonwalk' bug
- When link is trying to cut a grass tile being too close nothing happens
- Sometimes the Dialog box is displayed too far in the right
