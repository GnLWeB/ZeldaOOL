- Edit clipRects to work with view in Image and Map
- Fix Sword spin attack
- Fix Sound
	=> Little noise at start
	=> Delay between music
	=> Only one sound effect plays when there should be many others too
- Fix hearts (some are displayed out of the stats bar, comment SDL_RenderSetScale(...) line in Window.cpp to see them)
- Check all display SDL-related files, and refactor them if needed
	=> Also check 'double', replacing by 'float'
- Player can move out of the maps when sword is loading
	=> virtual bool PlayerState::canStartMapTransition();
- Sometimes, when spamming 'X' key at game start, the attack animation plays more than one time
- It's possible to re-attack during spin attack
- Fix grassDestroy animation
- Add 'Enemy' pure virtual class, child of 'Character'
- Fix 'moonwalk' bug
- Should write a class "Scene":
	=> Represents the current map
	-> Contains a Map
	-> Contains a std::vector of Entity
	-> Contains infos for Entity
	-> Sets the way each Entity interacts with another
	-> Draws on-map animations
- Add 'SceneManager'
	-> It associates each map and its entities into a 'Scene'
- Add 'Transition' pure virtual class, and its children 'TransitionScrolling', 'TransitionFade', etc...
- Improve 'TransitionScrolling' to be closer to the original game
